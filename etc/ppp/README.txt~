1) In order to use GPRS we had to :
   a)  Rebuild the Yocto Linux kernel with ppp enabled  
   b)  Enable GPIO 0 and 1 pins on UART0 ( source configs/enable_serial_port )
       Note:  the GPRS shield maps UART0 to Serial1 which is ttyMFD1 in Linux
   c)  Create a script to connect to the GPRS network 
       ( controller/attach_gprs.py ) 
   d)  Start ppp on boot after connecting
   e)  Create a bridge between ppp0 and the onboard wifi

2) The GPRS shield has an active SIM card that currently uses a T-Mobile
pre-paid plan.  The PDP context and connect string are specific to T-Mobile. If a
different SIM card is used, change /controller/attach_python.py and create a
new provider script and a new chat script.  

3) The startup script is in /etc/init.d/startup.sh
